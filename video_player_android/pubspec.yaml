name: flutter_cached_video_android
description: flutter_cached_video_android is the Android implementation of the flutter_cached_video plugin, offering video caching up to 512 MB. When the cache exceeds this limit, the oldest videos are automatically removed, ensuring optimal storage management. Built on ExoPlayer, it delivers seamless playback, reducing buffering and enhancing the user experience. The package retains the same API as video_player, making integration easy. Ideal for content-heavy apps, it boosts video performance by enabling efficient caching and ensuring offline availability.
